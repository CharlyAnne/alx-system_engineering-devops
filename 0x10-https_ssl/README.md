## This directory contains the solution to HTTPS SSL tasks.

The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the same transfer protocol as http, the only difference is that is a secure way of doing it. The 's' stands for secure, it adds encryption and decryption to the protocol. Https ensures that data transfered between client and server on the internet cannot be understood by a third party even if they are able to intercept the data being transfered.
